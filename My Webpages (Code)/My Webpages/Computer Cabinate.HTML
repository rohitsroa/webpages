A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, tower, system unit, cabinet, base unit, or simply case, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a computer.
</LI>
<BR>
<LI>
Cases are usually constructed from steel. Plastic is sometimes used, and other materials such as glass, wood and even Lego bricks have appeared in home-built cases.

 Cases can come in many different sizes (known as form factors).
 </LI>
 <BR>
 <LI>
 The size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the form factor of the <U>motherboard</U>, since it is the largest component of most computers.

 Computer cases usually include sheet metal enclosures for a power supply unit and drive bays, as well as a rear panel that can accommodate peripheral connectors protruding from the motherboard and expansion slots.
 </LI>
 <LI>
 Most cases also have a power button or switch, a reset button, and LEDs to indicate power status as well as hard drive[citation needed] and network activity (in some models).
 </LI>
 <LI>
 Some cases include built-in I/O ports (such as USB and headphone ports) on the front of the case. Such a case will also include the wires needed to connect these ports, switches and indicators to the motherboard.

 <LI>
Accessing the interior components of a modern tower case is done by removing the side panels. Looking front-to-back, accessing the motherboard, PSU, drive bays and most case fan installation points is done by removing the left side panel. 
 </LI>
<LI>
Removing the right side panel is done less often to access the space behind the motherboard mounting plate.
</LI> 
<LI>
This space is devoted to cable management, as cables routed in front of the motherboard will cause disruptions in the flow of air within the case.
